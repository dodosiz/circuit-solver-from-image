<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This project demonstrates a method for solving electrical dc
circuits from an image. Methods of computer vision are used throughout
the programm.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The project is structured in directories based on the stage of analysis.
Specifically, the main directories are listed bellow:
<ul>
<li><b>recognize</b> contains methods to recognize the patterns in the image</li>
<li><b>ocr_manipulations</b> is used to recognize characters on the image</li>
<li><b>nodes_and_centers</b> finds the topology or the way elements are connected</li>
<li><b>node_analysis</b> contains all the methods to solve the circuit</li>
</ul>
